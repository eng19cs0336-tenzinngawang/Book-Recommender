# Book Recommendation App
Deployed with Heroku at : <a href="https://bookrec-app.herokuapp.com/" > https://bookrec-app.herokuapp.com/ </a>


<b> Project: </b> Build a recommender system that could update recommendations based on read books stored by user in a database.

I listen to a lot of audiobooks and often find myself seeking out "similar books" as soon as I finish one so I am constantly looking for new books to read. Usually the best recommendations come from my husband, who reads a lot of the same books as I do but I figured I could find more books if I extend that pool of 'similar readers'. A book recommender system seemed a logical first step. 

### Dataset
I started with the <a href = "http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/"> Book Crossing </a> dataset compiled by Craig Nicolas Ziegler in order to build recommender system. These data include both implicit ratings and explicit ratings. In this case, explicit ratings are actual ratings of books on a scale of 1 - 10 indictated the extent to which the user enjoyed the book. Implict readings are simply 'yes/no'; did this user read this book? While implicit ratings are much easier to gather from users, I choose to base my recommender off of explicit ratings so that it was easier to rank the recommendations from 'most likely to be enjoyed' to 'least likely to be enjoyed'. 

### Model
The recommender was built loosely from the Machine Learning Coursera Assignment for <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?action=enroll" > recommender systems</a>.

To reduce the data, I separated the ratings into implicit and explicit ratings. I also deleted any users who had only read books not in the books dataset and removed books not read by any users in the user dataset. To make the most efficient database, I also compacted books with the same title and author into a single ISBN. This increases the rating count for most books and makes searching the database for specific books much more straight forward. Finally, to reduce the size of the eventual pivot table I also removed books and users with under a minimum number of ratings/books. 

The recommender system makes use of user-based collaborative filtering. For a given user, the 8 most similar users are found through a k-neighbors algorithm. The recommendations are then made from the books read by these 8 similar users by minimizing the cost function for these 8 users and considering 10 features. The top 10 books with the highest expected ratings are then returned as recommendations. 

The base implementation of the recommender is in <a href = "https://github.com/astrojneil/bookRec/blob/main/BookRecommender.ipynb" > this jupyter notebook</a>, and is implemented for the app in <a href = "https://github.com/astrojneil/bookRec/blob/main/recommender.py" > recommender.py </a>. 

### Database
The easiest way to store the book/rating dataset as well as the information for new users was with an sqlite database. The conversion from the original .csv files to a database is found in <a href="https://github.com/astrojneil/bookRec/blob/main/create_db.py"> create_db.py </a>. This script constructs the tables within the database as well as performs the cleaning described above.

Books and Users are also treated as their own classes in order to optimize the recommend, add and display functions within the app. they are implemented in <a href = "https://github.com/astrojneil/bookRec/blob/main/books.py" > books.py </a> and <a href = "https://github.com/astrojneil/bookRec/blob/main/users.py" > users.py </a> respectively. 

### App
In order to make recommendations for new users, I constructed an app with flask. I adapted the <a href = "https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/factory/" > Flask Blog Post Tutorial </a> to save users' book and ratings to a specific profile and generate a home page that lists recommendations based on the users' stored books. 

### Other Features
A newly added feature includes an 'add new book' function which makes use of the <a href = "https://developers.google.com/books" >Google Books API</a> to find the author and ISBN of a book given the user's input title. 

### Future Goals
Future goals for this project include expanding the existing book review database to include more users and more books, as the original Book Crossing database is beginning to be outdated. With the app deployed as a web-app open to the general public there is already a 'crowd-source' approach to building the database.
